# QuickHash
A simple filename hashing utility for MGSV:TPP

Enter the path and real name for a file under "File Path" and press the process button to calculate a file's hashed name! The filename must
use forward slashes, begin with a forward slash, and must NOT include the extension.

Example of a correctly entered filename:

>/Assets/tpp/chara/qui/Pictures/qui0_face0_def_bsm

Using the example above, you would receive the following as the output:

>245f7164a964b
